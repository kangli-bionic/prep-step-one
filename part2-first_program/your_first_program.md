# Your First Program

Ready to write your first Ruby program? In the Repl.it file below (the white top
section), you'll see we've written the code `puts "Hello, world"`. Type `puts
"Hello, world"` for yourself in the Repl.it shell (the dark blue bottom section)
and press enter.

If `Hello, world!` printed in your shell, then congratulations: you're already a
programmer! Now let's think like a programmer by investigating this code's
components and how they cooperate to make a program. A **program** is a sequence
of instructions that a computer executes to perform a specific task ( in this
case, printing `Hello, world`).

**Note:** Throughout this curriculum, please experiment with the code in the examples and
type and run your own code in the shell (the dark blue bottom section) to
practice and test your understanding of Ruby.


## `puts "Hello, world!"`

You've learned that the quotation marks enclosing `"Hello, world!"` denote a
string; however, you haven't learn what `puts` means. `puts` is not a number,
string, boolean or nil.

`puts` is not an object at all. Instead, `puts` is a _method_. We'll cover methods more
thoroughly in later chapters, but for now think of methods as performing an
action on an object. `puts` performs the action of printing the string `"Hello,
world"`.

You can use `puts` with an object of any data type. Try running these in the
shell:

`puts nil` prints nothing. Can you think of why?

You've already run five programs! Time for your first bug.
