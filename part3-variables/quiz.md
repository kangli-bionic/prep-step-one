    <answer><code>aCaseThatLikeAWoundedSnakeDragsItsSlowLengthAlong</code></answer>

a = true
b = "dog"
b = a

  <question>
    <p>What is the value of <code>b</code> at the end of the above code snippet?</p>
    <answer correct><code>true</code></answer>
    <answer><code>7</code></answer>
    <answer><code>b</code></answer>
    <answer><code>"dog"</code></answer>
    <explanation><code>b</code> is last assigned to <code>a</code> when the value of <code>a</code> is <code>true</code>. Therefore the final value of <code>b</code> is <code>true</code>.</explanation>

    <answer><code>b</code></answer>
    <answer><code>"dog"</code></answer>

a = true
b = "dog"
a = c
```

<quiz>
  <question>
    <p>Why might the last line of the above code snippet cause an error?</p>
    <answer><code>c</code> is <code>nil</code>.</answer>
    <answer><code>a</code> cannot be reassigned.</answer>
    <answer><code>c</code> is an invalid variable name.</answer>
    <answer correct><code>c</code> is undefined.</answer>
    <explanation>The fourth choice is correct. <code>c</code> is a valid variable name because it's in snake case and is not a Ruby keyword. <code>a</code> can be reassigned because any variable can be reassigned at any time. The value of <code>c</code> is not <code>nil</code> because <code>c</code> is undefined. A defined variable with a value of <code>nil</code> is different from a variable that is undefined, i.e., that is never assigned a value.</explanation>
