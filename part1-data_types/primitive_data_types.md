# Primitive Data Types


Before we can begin programming, which—at the most basic level—involves
manipulating data, we need to learn what kinds of data we can manipulate. All
programming languages have built-in primitive data types. __Primitive data
types__ are a programming language's fundamental building blocks. They are types
of **objects**, Ruby's representation of data. Objects are the nouns of Ruby.

Ruby has five primitive data types, but you'll only need to learn the following
four to pass the online challenge.

**Strings:** A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are denoted by enclosing double (`""`)
or single (`''`) quotation marks. `"dog"`, `"3 logs"`, and `"the brown dog
jumped over the 3 logs"` are all strings. Strings can be of any length. `""` is
an _empty string_ (a string of length zero). Remember to wrap strings in quotation
marks. Otherwise Ruby will misinterpret the code.

**Numbers:** In Ruby, we call any whole number—positive or negative (including 0)—an
_integer_. `9` and `-4` are both integers. Fractional numbers (with decimal
points) such as `3.1415` are called _floats_ or _floating point numbers_. Some
mathematical operations in Ruby function differently depending on whether the
number is a float or an integer. By the way, don't use include commas in
integers. Writing `4,000` instead of `4000` will confuse Ruby.

**Booleans:** There are only two boolean values: `true` and `false`. Booleans provide the core
logic of computer programs. `4 > 5` is `false`, and `4 < 5` is `true`. Note that
booleans are case sensitive. `true` is a boolean, `True` is not. And `"true"` is
a string, not a boolean.

**Nil:** Ruby represents nothingness with the keyword `nil`. Sometimes the absence of data is as
important as data itself.
