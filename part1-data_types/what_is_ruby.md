# What is Ruby?

As a programmer, your job is to take a problem and break it down into smaller problems
until you reach tasks simple enough to be comprehensible to a computer.

In this course, you'll use a programming language to communicate tasks to your
computer. A computer program is a series of instructions in a programming
language.

There are many programming languages, but we'll learn Ruby. Ruby is an elegant
programming language perfect for students who are beginning to code. It's also
powerful and expressive, which makes it a great choice for advanced programmers.
