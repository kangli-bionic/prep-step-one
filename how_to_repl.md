# How to Use Repl.it

To write and run code throughout the prep work, youâ€™ll work in a website called
Repl.it (embedded below).

The bottom (dark blue) part of the screen is the shell, which allows you to run
Ruby code line by line. Type `puts "hello"` in the shell and press enter. Type
`2 + 2` and press enter.

The top (white) part of the screen is a Ruby file. Unlike the shell, you can
write multiple lines of code in the file and run them all at once by clicking
_run_. Type `puts "hello"` in the file. Press enter to create a new line and
type `2 + 2`. Click _run_. You'll see the output of running the Ruby file in the
shell.

You're now ready to code alongside our examples. You can use either the shell
(bottom) or the file (top) to write your code, but it'll be easier to write
multiline code in the file.
